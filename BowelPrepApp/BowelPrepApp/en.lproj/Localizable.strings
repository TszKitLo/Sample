Your ride will have to then drive you back home, since you cannot drive.\n\nSome patients may experience bloating or pass gas for hours after the procedure. This is normal and is because air was pumped into your colon during the procedure in order to make sure all areas of the colon were adequately examined.\n\nSome patients may also notice a small amount of blood with the first bowel movement after the exam. This is usually not a cause for concern. However, if you continue to pass blood or blood clots, have a fever above 100 degree Fahrenheit (38.7 C), have severe abdominal pain, then please call your doctor’s office or the on-call person, as these symptoms may indicate ongoing bleeding, or a perforation.";

However, if you suffer from constipation, it may be harder for you to start going, and your colon may be slower to respond.\n\nIf you have not had a bowel movement even after 3 hours of drinking the bowel prep, drink more fluids.  Remember that you should drink about 12 tall glasses of clear liquids throughout the day in addition to the bowel prep liquid.
